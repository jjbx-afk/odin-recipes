             <h1>Fried Chicks</h1>

             <img src="../imgs/friedchicksimg.webp">

             <h4>Description :</h4>

              <p>Here’s a simple recipe for crispy fried chicken. Start by marinating your chicken pieces (thighs and drumsticks work well) in a mixture of buttermilk, salt,
                 black pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight for maximum flavor and tenderness. 
                 Meanwhile, prepare the breading by combining all-purpose flour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and cayenne pepper in a separate bowl.</p> 

             <p>When you’re ready to cook, heat about 2 inches of vegetable or peanut oil in a deep skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat. 
                Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing any excess buttermilk to drip off, then coat each piece thoroughly in the seasoned flour mixture. 
                Carefully place the chicken in the hot oil, frying in batches to avoid overcrowding. Cook each piece for about 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally, 
                until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through. Drain on paper towels and serve hot, crispy, and delicious! </p>
